This is the HPQC to JIRA link project.

It started out as a "sync" tool to sync HPQC Defects with JIRA Issues. These files are stored under the old package 

The requirements have now changed to the point where we are customizing this down to the workflow.

We use the JIRA REST API and the HP ALM REST API standards in this project.
